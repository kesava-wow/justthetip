* bump toc
* embed callbackhandler, whoops

* use kuiconfig (so there are profiles, but I haven't added a non-script way of editing them yet)
* use libsharedmedia for fonts
* add npc "title" text (like trade supplies, flight master, etc)
* brighten class colour slightly by default
* brighten tapped unit colour (such that you can still see health)
